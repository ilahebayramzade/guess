User Guess Number Game 🎲

This project is an interesting and simple game written in Python. Here the computer chooses a number, and you try to guess that number. I made the project for fun and to improve my programming skills. 😊

📋 About the Project
- Game Logic:
- The computer chooses a random number.
- Your goal is to guess that number correctly.
- Every time you guess, the computer gives you a hint "too big", "too small" or "correct".
- Python Code: The game logic and functions are written by me.
- HTML Visual: Written with the help of AI to make it more interactive and easy to share with others.

💻 How Does It Work?
1. Launch the game and start guessing a randomly selected number.
2. Change your guesses based on the hints given by the computer.
3. When you find the correct number, the game will end and it will show how many guesses you made.

🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x must be installed.

🚀 How to Use?
